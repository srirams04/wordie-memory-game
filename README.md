# Wordie: A Memory-Strengthening Game for the Elderly

**Problem:** Memory-related illnesses like Alzheimer's and Dementia affect many elderly individuals. Research suggests regular memory stimulation can help prevent or slow their progression.

**Solution:** Wordie is a tactile word-building game designed to strengthen memory in seniors at risk of dementia. Its engaging gameplay encourages short-term recall and spatial reasoning, key cognitive functions impacted by these conditions.

_Wordie revolves around making words using lettered dice._
_If you have played Scrabble before, assume that you have to now form just a single word, but you are **partially blind** and the **tiles are moving**. To be more precise, they are revolving._

## **Rules of the Game:**
1. In Wordie, words are to be formed using lettered dice.
2. Drop the die in the allotted slot, while the remaining slots are hidden.
3. Press a push button, which rotates the slots by one, thus opening different slots in every round to drop in a die.
4. Finally, on completion of the word, the player will be able to check if they formed the intended word
   
## **Features:**

-   **Rotating dice slots:**  Hidden slots conceal letters, challenging players to remember their positions and build a word sequentially.
-   **Push-button reveal:**  Rotates the slots one step, forcing players to recall previous moves and anticipate possible letter combinations.
-   **Adjustable difficulty:**  Different word lengths and slot configurations cater to various cognitive abilities.
-   **Tactile design:**  Large, numbered slots and chunky dice ensure ease of use for those with dexterity limitations.

## **Benefits:**

-   **Improves short-term memory:**  Players must remember past letter placements and utilize them to form the final word.
-   **Enhances spatial reasoning:**  Remembering slot positions and anticipating rotations strengthens spatial awareness.
-   **Provides cognitive stimulation:**  Engaging gameplay keeps the mind active and promotes neural connections.
